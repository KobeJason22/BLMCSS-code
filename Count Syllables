Sure! Here's a Python program that uses a simple approach to calculate the total number of syllables in a given passage:

```python
def count_syllables(word):
    count = 0
    vowels = "aeiouyAEIOUY"
    if word[0] in vowels:
        count += 1
    for index in range(1, len(word)):
        if word[index] in vowels and word[index-1] not in vowels:
            count += 1
    if word.endswith('e'):
        count -= 1
    if word.endswith('le') and len(word) > 2 and word[-3] not in vowels:
        count += 1
    if count == 0:
        count += 1
    return count

def count_total_syllables(passage):
    words = passage.split()
    total_syllables = 0
    for word in words:
        total_syllables += count_syllables(word)
    return total_syllables

passage = input("Enter the passage: ")
total_syllables = count_total_syllables(passage)
print("Total syllables:", total_syllables)
```

In this program, we define two functions. The `count_syllables` function takes a word as input and counts the number of syllables in it using a simple set of rules. The `count_total_syllables` function takes a passage as input, splits it into individual words, and calculates the total number of syllables by calling the `count_syllables` function for each word.

You can run this program and enter your desired passage. It will calculate and display the total number of syllables in the passage.
